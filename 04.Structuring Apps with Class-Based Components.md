## functional Components vs Class Components
<pre>
1. functional : Good for simple contents (1~3 Lecture)
2. class : Good for just about everything else (complex logic)
</pre>

## Why? Class Components are better
<pre>
1. Easier code organization
2. Can use 'state' (another React system) -> Easier to handle user input
3. Understands lifecycle events -> Easier to do things when the app first starts
</pre>

## Geolocation API(mozilla)
<pre>
get cuurent location of user 
</pre>

## Life cycle of Gelocation App
<pre>
1. JS file loaded by browser
2. App component gets created
3. We call geolocation service (*take amount of time!*)
4. App returns JSX, get rendered to page as HTML
..
5. We get result of geolocation!
-> Tell the component to rerender itself with this new information
</pre>

## Rules of Class Component
<pre>
1. Must be a Javascript Class
2. Must extend (subclass) React.Component
3. Must define a 'render' method that returns some amount of JSX
</pre>

## Rules of State
<pre>
1. Only usable with class components
2. You will confused props with state 
3. 'State' is a JS oject that contains data relevant to a component
4. Updating 'state' on a component causes the component to (almost) instantly rerender
5. State must be initialized when a component is created
6. State can *only* be updated using the function *'setState'*
</pre>
